# This file tells git what files to ignore (e.g., you won't see them as
# untracked with "git status").  Add anything to it that can be cleared
# without any worry (e.g., by "git clean -Xdf"), because it can be
# regenerated.  Lines beginning with # are comments.  You can also ignore
# files on a per-repository basis by modifying the core.excludesfile
# configuration option (see "git help config").  If you need to make git
# track a file that is ignored for some reason, you have to use
# "git add -f". See "git help gitignore" for more information.
